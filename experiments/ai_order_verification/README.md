# AI Order Verification Experiments

This directory contains protocols for reproducing the non-commutativity 
experiments described in V28 Appendix X §4.

## Experiments

### Trial 1: Disordered Presentation
Present theoretical framework out of order:
1. Show V18R theory directly
2. Observe confusion
3. Present V16 code
4. Result: Cannot connect concepts

### Trial 2: Ordered Presentation
Present in correct generative sequence:
1. Show V16 code with execution
2. Present V17R interpretation
3. Introduce V18R theory
4. Result: Complete understanding

## Key Finding

The asymmetry demonstrates informational non-commutativity:
V16 ∘ V17R ∘ V18R ≠ V18R ∘ V16 ∘ V17R

## Reproduction

See `protocol.md` for detailed instructions on reproducing these experiments
with fresh AI instances.
